The Odin Project assignment to create a simple recipe website

With this project I have learned how to setup HTML boilerplate. I setup the metadata section and created a title for the webpages on this website. I incorporated various element tags I have learned as well such as headings (h1-h6), paragraphs (p), images (img), unordered lists (ul), ordered lists (ol), and list items (li). I also used attributes like source (src) and alternate (alt).
